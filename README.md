Udacity MLND Project 4 - Train a Smartcab to Drive

This is my submission for Project 4 ('Train a Smartcab to Drive') on Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 

The project brief asked the student to apply reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time. 

## List of files
**Directories**
- `/logs/`: contains log files that are given from the simulation when specific prerequisites are met
- `/images/`: contains various images of cars to be used in the graphical user interface
- `/smartcab/`: contains the Python scripts that create the environment, graphical user interface, the simulation, and the agents

**Files**
- `smartcab.ipynb`: completed submission file (Jupyter Notebook)
- `visuals.py`: supporting code (provided by Udacity)
